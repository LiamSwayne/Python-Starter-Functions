# Python_Functions_Library
A collection of simple Python functions for quality-of-life improvement.

These functions provide quick ways to execute simple functions that are commonplace among other languages, but missing in python. For example, printing without a newline just by typing one additional character instead of ten. A simple URL to text function is provided for simple web scraping.

The comments are very barebones and informal. This is for beginners who are new to Python.
