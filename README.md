# Python Starter Functions
*Note: The comments for all the functions in this repository are very barebones and informal. This is for beginners who are new to Python.*

**starter_functions.py** is a collection of simple Python functions for quality-of-life improvement. These functions provide quick ways to execute simple functions that are commonplace among other languages, but missing in python. For example, printing without a newline just by typing one additional character instead of ten. A simple URL to text function is provided for easy web scraping.
